## User Story
As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles

# Functionality

From the command line you are prompted your name, email, office number, and id. You are then asked how many team mates are on your team, and your team is built. It then asks  for specific information ( schools, git hub user names, emails) for each role on the team. It then generates  each tema member info to an html to display your team.
